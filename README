Welcome to chess.el, a client and library for playing Chess from
Emacs.

chess.el is an Emacs Lisp library and several clients on top of the underlying
library functionality for performing various activities related
to the game of chess.
You can play against an external chess program such as gnuchess,
crafty, phalanx or sjeng.  All of them are publically available,
and chess.el will automatically detect which one
you have installed, provided they have standard executable
program names, and are in a located in a directory which
is part of the PATH.  See the customisable variable 
`chess-default-engine'.

You can also play against another human or computer over the internet
(through a direct Emacs-to-Emacs connection, or
on one of the Internet Chess Servers like freechess.org or
chessclub.com), or even against a very simple chess thinking
module implemented in pure Emacs Lisp.

chess.el also provides a mode for editing Portable Game Notation (PGN
files.

To improve your chessaility, you might also like to have
a look at chess-puzzle, which allows you to solve
chess puzzle collections (in PGN or EPD format) against
one of the engines you have installed.

HISTORY

chess.el started out as a single file project with
version 1.0 by John Wiegley <johnw@gnu.org>.  Version 2.0 is a major
rewrite and reorganisation of the original code, also done
by John Wiegley.  In the end of 2003, John did not
have a lot of time to finish all the various aspects of version 2.0,
and maintainership was given to Mario Lang <mlang@delysid.org>.
