	* chess-ics.el: Only send startup commands after login has succeeded.

	* chess-ics.el: Send the "set style 12" command immediately,
	rather than after the first move.

	* all: Removed the $ Revision strings; they are no longer
	necessary since I tag every revision that I upload.

	* chess-ics.el: set en-passent status

	* chess-announce.el: german messages (no idea on how to synth yet
	:) )

	* chess-ics.el: CR stripping removed/commented.

	* chess-engine.el: Only set process-filter if it isn't already set
	to comint-output-filter

	* chess-var.el, TODO, chess-algebraic.el, chess-display.el,
	chess-game.el, chess-pgn.el, chess-ply.el, chess-pos.el: Major
	speed improvement and efficiency work.  chess-legal-plies is much
	more memory conservative now.  Reduced recursion in
	chess-search-position by a slight bit.

	* chess.el: bumped minor rev

	* chess-display.el: Compute the mode-line text only once, whenever
	the current game index is changed.  This saves hundreds of calls
	to chess-ply-to-algebraic, which were occurring simply because of
	mode-line updates!

	* chess-algebraic.el: Keep the :which determiner, if ever we
	calculate it in chess-ply-to-algebraic.

	* ChangeLog, PLAN: new file

	* chess-plain.el: whitespace fix

	* chess-display.el, chess-engine.el: Removed
	`chess-with-current-buffer', since it is now in chess-module.el.

	* chess-plain.el: Added var chess-plain-spacing (default 0) to be
	able to widen the board.  (I am sure that broke highlighting)

	* chess-ics.el: Added comments to chess-parse-ics12 to describe
	the format

	* Did some major performance work on chess-legal-plies,
	chess-ply-create and chess-search-position (these three, together
	with chess-pos-move, represent the majority of algorithmic work
	done by chess.el).

	* Created this file.
