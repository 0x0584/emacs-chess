@ifinfo
@top Chess.el

Chess.el is an Emacs chess environment, designed in a modular fashion to
be used either as a library for writing chess-related programs, or as a
plain client for playing chess, analyzing variations, or browsing
historical games.

The purpose of this manual is to help you understand how Chess.el is
structured for use as a library, and also how to use the optional
modules which make it useful as a client.  These modules also serve as
an example of how to make use of the library.
