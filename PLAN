TEST: chess-chat, chess-kibitz, chess-scid, chess-irc (CTCP)
TRANSLATE: chess-german

chess-pos
- break chess-legal-plies into two parts, one of which would be the
  inverse of chess-search-position, and would live in chess-pos.el

chess-engine
- the game should go inactive once I lose by stalemate/checkmate
- detect draw/resign/abort/retract, etc., from ICS and common engines
- find a way that regexp-alist entries that only need to fire once are
  only scanned once.
- in chess-engine-filter and chess-ics-filter, if an error is
  encountered, skip that line so the same error isn't triggered again
- implement engine options; then, in chess-puzzle set the option that
  tells the engine not to resign.

chess-ics
- add support for ICS observing
- make sure that helpers are allowed in the ics-server-alist

chess-clock
- when a clock runs down, indicate this in the modeline, and allow the
  user to call-flag in order to win on time; note: the user should be
  allowed to try anyway, in case our clock has become out-of-sync with
  the server's
