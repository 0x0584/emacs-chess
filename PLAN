chess-ply
- Add :nag, :rav, :ann and :next-pos keywords to a ply
- When creating the next position, set the annotations to point to the
  keywords of the ply that led to that position; in fact, just point
  to the creating ply!
- Thus there will be a mirror set of chess-pos-has-keyword, etc.,
  functions

chess-epd
- based on chess-fen, this will also be a database module for
  accessing positions within an EPD file

chess-ics
- detect draw/resign/retract, etc.
- add support for ICS observing

chess-clock
- when a clock runs down, indicate this in the modeline, and allow the
  user to call-flag in order to win on time; note: the user should be
  allowed to try anyway, in case our clock has become out-of-sync with
  the server's
- when the clock goes under, it starts counting up!  Need a "-0".

chess-images
- in a generic emacs, with a light background, there are white lines
  in wierd places on the chessboard

The PGN chapter of the manual is not fully representative of the
original, owing to the lack of subsubsubsection in texinfo.
