chess-ply
- Add :nag, :rav, :ann and :next-pos keywords to a ply
- When creating the next position, set the annotations to point to the
  keywords of the ply that led to that position; in fact, just point
  to the creating ply!
- Thus there will be a mirror set of chess-pos-has-keyword, etc.,
  functions

chess-display
- there is no way to call flag right now

chess-ics
- detect draw/resign/retract, etc.
- add support for ICS observing

chess-clock
- when a clock runs down, indicate this in the modeline, and allow the
  user to call-flag in order to win on time; note: the user should be
  allowed to try anyway, in case our clock has become out-of-sync with
  the server's

chess-images
- in a generic emacs, with a light background, there are white lines
  in wierd places on the chessboard
