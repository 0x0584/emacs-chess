chess-ply
- When creating the next position, set the annotations to point to the
  keywords of the ply that led to that position; in fact, just point
  to the creating ply!
- Add :nag, :rav, :ann and :next-pos keywords to a ply
- Thus there will be a mirror set of chess-pos-has-keyword, etc.,
  functions
- Need to detect games drawn by three-fold repetition

chess-display
- there is no way to call flag right now
- invert the mode line to show the side on move?

chess-ics
- detect draw/retract, etc.
- add support for ICS observing

chess-clock
- when a clock runs down, allow the user to call-flag in order to win
  on time; note: the user should be allowed to try anyway, in case our
  clock has become out-of-sync with the server's

- in a generic emacs, with a light background, there are white lines
  in wierd places on the chessboard
