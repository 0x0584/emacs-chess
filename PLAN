chess-ics
- takebacks still aren't working 100%; when I submit a takeback
  request manually, and the other side accepts, my client doesn't know
  what to do with it
- some <12> lines aren't being parsed at all; is the filter missing
  them?
- accept of a match request doesn't seem to be working

chess-display
- when I checkmate my opponent, the display says "Black ...#"
- on the first position, "White" has no white background

chess-images
- if chess-display-popup is nil, and I resize the board, it merely
  deletes the frame and never shows it again

chess-engine
- if I say "y" to accepting something from my opponent (new game,
  takeback, etc), I get left with an hourglass cursor

chess-irc
- if I move before my opponent has connected, I get a symbol assertion
  about "value"

chess-ply
- detect games drawn by three-fold repetition

chess-german
- complete translation

general
- add an 'install' target to the Makefile
- use more asserts throughout the code
