chess-autosave
- this module currently isn't working at all!

chess-ics
- takebacks still aren't working 100%; when I submit a takeback
  request manually, and the other side accepts, my client doesn't know
  what to do with it
- some <12> lines aren't being parsed at all; is the filter missing
  them?
- accept of a match request doesn't seem to be working always
- if I resign by typing "resign", it doesn't get caught; in general, I
  need a more robust way of signalling events, so that I never get out
  of sync with the server

chess-clock
- sometimse, the clock gets shut off (while playing on ICS) for no
  reason that I can determine

chess-display
- sometimes the final event of a game doesn't change the modeline,
  like CHECKMATE, or FLAG FELL
- if I win a game, it still reports CHECKMATE incorrect; if I'm white,
  it does so on the last ply (per display)
- when my opponent took with en passant, it didn't paint the taken
  pawn square as blank

chess-input
- In the following game, it wouldn't let me type "rh" to move Rh5,
  when it was the only possible move

chess-images
- if chess-display-popup is nil, and I resize the board, it merely
  deletes the frame and never shows it again

chess-engine
- if I say "y" to accepting something from my opponent (new game,
  takeback, etc), I get left with an hourglass cursor
- if no chess engine is available, there is no nice message being
  printed

chess-irc
- if I move before my opponent has connected, I get a symbol assertion
  about "value"

chess-ply
- detect games drawn by three-fold repetition

chess-pos
- if I checkmate someone, the last position does not have its status
  set to :checkmate

chess-german
- complete translation

general
- add an 'install' target to the Makefile
- use more asserts throughout the code
- profile and mem profile
- elint all files
- add docstrings/texi content
- use checkdoc on all files
