- Feature work remaining:

  2.0
    annotations
    chatting
  2.x
    display/database tie-in
    analysis/highlight tools
    bughouse/crazyhouse

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Make the drawing/highlighting code just touch single squares, rather
  than redrawing the whole board each time (fast though this is,
  touching single squares is all that's necessary, and it would be
  even faster)

- Fix highlighting in chess-plain when chess-plain-spacing is set.
  chess-coord needs to be applied to a larger area, and also the way
  highlight locations are found needs to be recalculated.

- Change all of the highlighting functions to use properties to find
  out where the highlighting region should begin.

- Move keyboard shortcutting and mouse selection into their own
  modules

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- The game should go inactive once I lose by stalemate/checkmate

- When a clock runs down, indicate this in the modeline, and all the
  user to call-flag in order to win on time

- Detect draw/resign/abort/retract, etc., from ICS and common engines

- in chess-engine-filter and chess-ics-filter, if an error is
  encountered, skip that line so the same error isn't triggered again

- SPACE to pass, then try to move (against an engine) fails saying
  it's not our turn to move

- Add support for adjournments; also, implement this is such a way
  that an e-mail or postal game is basically a game that's adjourned
  after every move; use BBDB if available

- Allow databases to return a game moniker, which can be used to
  reference that game again

- There needs to be much more robustness; it's too easy to get the
  game into an unplayable state right now

- Break my dependency on cl

- Use more asserts throughout the code

- Read-only mode needs to be more vigorous.  There's nothing
  preventing the user from using M-x commands.

- Complete chess-pgn-mode's automatic entry

- Make any game-modifying commands in a display use C-c C-?

- Use MIME attachments (application/x-chess-pgn) for sending e-mail
  chess games back and forth.

- Copy some of ics.el's nicer functionality into chess-ics.el

- Complete the ICS12 parser, based on Mario's comments

- Add support for ICS observing

- Make the mode-line much more informative, with information on who is
  playing, etc.

- Use server-side sockets in chess-network, if Emacs supports it

- Allow ASCII displays to use a separate frame

- In edit mode, mouse-2 and mouse-3 should provide a drop-down list of
  pieces the square can be set to.  Cursor movement is really not the
  best for chess-images.  I still need to figure out how best to
  handle cursor-type with that display.

- Still need to test many areas: position editing

- Implement engine options; then, in chess-puzzle set the option that
  tells the engine not to resign.

- Remote displays are horribly insecure.

- Resize the chess board on a window resize event, if possible.

- Add chess-game-strip-annotations, for removing all annotations from
  a game object

- Let the user specify a default size for the chess-images display

- Port image display code to XEmacs

			  Training features

- Allow the opponent to give hints.

- Add a warning mode that will use the results of an analysis to warn
  the user (and ask for confirmation) before doing something that
  might lead to an inferior position.

- Add a chess tutor program, to teach people how to play chess

			  Analysis features

- Add an engine function for obtaining an evaluation of the current
  position.  Then, allow M-x chess to startup a non-game oriented
  engine, solely for the purpose of submitting position evaluations,
  and displaying the result in the modeline.  (Also, look at crafty's
  kibitzing feature).

- Add a Map command, that will colorize the squares depending on
  whether they are reachable by either side.  Green if reachable by
  you, Red if by your opponent, and blue if by both.  With a prefix
  argument, colorize only the squares that have pieces on them.  This
  is a stable modes that remains in effect until turned off.  It also
  requires the ability to pass a color to the chessboard highlighting
  routine.

- Using gnuplot-mode, allow evaluation trends to be plotted

- Add an analyze command that will indicate which pieces are defended,
  how well, which are attacked, which moves would increase
  defense/attack/both, etc.  Basically, everything that can be known
  about the current board, and one move ahead (on both sides).
