- Feature work remaining:

  annotations
  chatting
  clocks
  bughouse/crazyhouse
  analysis/highlight tools
  scid interaction

- In M-x chess, if chess-images is being used, ensure that
  chess-images-directory is valid, otherwise fall back on chess-ics1.

- Turn on memory gc collection messages, and see how much of a pig
  chess.el is

- Profile!

- Add CTCP (optional) support to chess-irc.el

- Use server-side sockets in chess-network, if Emacs supports it

- In chess-fen-to-pos, syntax check incoming FEN strings

- Support auto-saving of games to PGN, and saving them at appropriate
  points

- Create a series of generic functions and predicates, so that users
  can say (chess-position OBJECT) or (chess-move OBJECT), without
  needing to know the type of OBJECT.

- Allow ASCII displays to use a separate frame

- Rewrite ics.el

- Make use of the my-color data in chess-game.el to ensure that I only
  do what I should be doing

- In edit mode, mouse-2 and mouse-3 should provide a drop-down list of
  pieces the square can be set to.  Cursor movement is really not the
  best for chess-images.  I still need to figure out how best to
  handle cursor-type with that display.

- Still need to test many areas: position editing

- Implement engine options; then, in chess-puzzle set the option that
  tells the engine not to resign.

- Add a display command for writing out the currently displayed game
  to a file.  It will use PGN for games, and FEN for positions.

- Remote displays are horribly insecure.

- When editing the board in display mode (or doing speculative moves),
  doing them on a copy of the board with no hook except the display
  hook.  Then, if you like the result, it call be a `set' on the
  original board from the copied board.

- Make the mode-line much more informative

- Resize the chess board on a window resize event, if possible.

- Have a display option that shows legal target squares whenever a
  piece is selected.

- Add chess-game-strip-annotations, for removing all annotations from
  a game object

- Add a module for chatting between opponents

- Let the user specify a default size for the chess-images display

- Allow dragging of pieces

- Need to check for chess engine resignations

- Need a chess-clock.el module, especially for playing on ICS

- Port image display code to XEmacs

- Support chess by mail, with direct tie-ins to Gnus/RMAIL.

- Allow the opponent to give hints.

- Add a command that will load a saved game, continue it, and then
  enter a move for whichever color is next to play.  This would make
  it trivial to add chess drivers to AIM, IRC, etc.  The mere command
  "!chess johnw37 Nf3" would mean: load the chess game johnw37, and
  make my move as Nf3.  It would also make chess by e-mail a snap to
  implement.

- Add an analyze command that will indicate which pieces are defended,
  how well, which are attacked, which moves would increase
  defense/attack/both, etc.  Basically, everything that can be known
  about the current board, and one move ahead (on both sides).

- Add a warning mode that will use the results of an analysis to warn
  the user (and ask for confirmation) before doing something that
  might lead to an inferior position.

- Create chess-player.el, which creates persistent objects that
  encapsulate information about any player: where he is, his name, his
  opponent type, etc.  This would maintain a log of games against that
  player, their current chess rating, etc.  Then, M-x chess would ask
  you for a player, not an opponent.

- Add a Map command, that will colorize the squares depending on
  whether they are reachable by either side.  Green if reachable by
  you, Red if by your opponent, and blue if by both.  With a prefix
  argument, colorize only the squares that have pieces on them.  This
  is a stable modes that remains in effect until turned off.  It also
  requires the ability to pass a color to the chessboard highlighting
  routine.

- If a person selects a piece with the mouse, then uses right-click to
  designate a target square, display the resulting board without
  making a move.  This requires copying chessboard-current-board to
  chessboard-draft-board.  If the user right-clicks without selecting
  a piece, it will reset to chessboard-current-board and redraw.
